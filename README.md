# nodeBlog
A basic blog build with node/mongodb/express/jade
=========


Was working but i guess an module via npm is old
so it throws an error and loads this
pretty site to hold
![kraken-js](public/images/kitkat.png)

Yea, i totally have to fix it, when i need to salvage from
it and make a newer, better version.
